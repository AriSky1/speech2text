# Speech2Text Multilingual Transcription

This project provides a **speech-to-text** application supporting **three languages**: English, French, and Russian. Using the powerful open-source [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) speech recognition toolkit, it converts spoken words into text in real time.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support:** Recognizes speech in English, French, and Russian with dedicated Vosk models for each.
- **Real-Time Transcription:** Captures audio live from the microphone and transcribes on the fly.
- **Simple Web Interface:** Allows users to start and stop recording via a browser interface.
- **Lightweight & Offline:** Runs locally without requiring internet connection once models are downloaded.

## Current Limitations

- **No Punctuation or Formatting Yet:**  
  The output text consists of plain words without punctuation marks, capitalization, or formatting. This means the text can feel continuous and harder to read compared to fully punctuated transcripts.

## Why It's Useful Even Without Punctuation

- **Fast and Immediate Transcription:**  
  For many use cases, getting a rough transcript quickly is more important than perfectly formatted text. Examples include voice commands, note-taking, and indexing audio content.

- **Foundation for Further Processing:**  
  The raw text output can be post-processed with natural language processing tools to add punctuation, capitalization, and improve readability later.

- **Multilingual Flexibility:**  
  Supporting multiple languages allows a wider range of users to benefit, especially in contexts where multilingual speech recognition is needed.

## How to Use

1. Select the language you want to transcribe.
2. Start recording and speak naturally.
3. Stop recording to get the transcribed text displayed.
4. Use or export the text as needed.
